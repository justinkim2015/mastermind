# mastermind

4/21/22
This is the second OOP project, my first tic-tac-toe
project was really difficult and I'm planning on 
refactoring it A LOT after I finish a few more projects
and read 99 bottles of OOP.

I hope to be able to do this project very OO and try to 
avoid procedural programming as much as I can.  I didn't 
take advantage of many types of enumeration or inheritance
or different types of loops last time but I hope to do it 
this time to keep my code shorter and more readable.  

Game Plan
make game mastermind
set up game logic
set up game logic for one round
how to display results in terminal
how to compare guess with hidden code
how to get guess from user
how to set a hidden code
